# Refugee-management-project
The Disaster Management & Refugee Camp System is a sophisticated full-stack web application designed to revolutionize the way humanitarian organizations manage refugee camps during disaster scenarios. This intelligent platform combines cutting-edge web technologies with advanced computer science algorithms to provide a comprehensive solution for real-time refugee tracking, optimal camp allocation, and efficient resource management.

🌍 Real-World ContextIn the aftermath of natural disasters, conflicts, or humanitarian crises, managing large-scale refugee movements becomes a critical challenge. Traditional paper-based or manual digital systems often fail to:

Quickly match refugees with appropriate camps.

Track real-time capacity and resource availability.

Optimize the distribution of camps across geographical regions.

Plan efficient evacuation routes during emergencies.

Provide data-driven insights for decision-makers.

This project addresses these challenges by creating an intelligent, automated system that brings order to chaos during critical moments.
